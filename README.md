## Characteristics and Explanation

- In this exercise, I used scraping technologies and PDF parsing libraries. It was my first project, and the purpose is to have something in my repository.

The first part of one exercise program to make life easier for delivery riders. It needs more improvements, like one scraper of the best delivery zones. It's not so useful really, and indeed it could really become better as a daily accounting app than a cost and profit app.

## Functioning

You enter the number of orders and the price they are paying optionally in the terminal, returning the total profits after the electricity expense.
