# PROJECT NAME

BOLT RIDER ELECTRO SCOOTER COST CALCULATION (PRAGUE)

## INSTALATION

In process, I'm not sure if it's neccesary since this is a exercise pourpouse project. May add in future.

## CHARACTERISTIC AND EXPLANATION

- In this exercise I used scraping technologies and PDF parsing libraries. It was my first project, and the pourpouse is to have something in my repository.

The first part of one exercise program to make easier life to delivery riders. It needs more improvements, like one scraper of the best delivery zones, but I
need to show to one friend now. Is not so usefull really, and indeed it could really become better on a daily accounting app than a cost and profit app.

## Functioning

You enter the number of orders and the price they are paying optionally in the terminal, returning the total profits after the electricity expense.
